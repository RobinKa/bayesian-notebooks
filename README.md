Some notebooks for doing bayesian modelling

- [Metropolis sampling](Metropolis.ipynb): Given a model that relates parameters to its output and samples of the output, infer the parameters that generated the samples.
- [Sleep happiness linear model](SleepHappy.ipynb): Fit a bayesian linear model to figure out how sleeping hours affect happiness.
